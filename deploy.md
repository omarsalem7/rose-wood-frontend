# Deployment Guide

## Problem Solved

The original error was caused by Tailwind CSS v4's dependency on `lightningcss` native binaries, which were missing on the Linux deployment environment.

## Solution Applied

1. **Downgraded to Tailwind CSS v3**: Removed `@tailwindcss/postcss` and `tailwindcss` v4, replaced with stable v3.4.17
2. **Updated PostCSS config**: Changed from `["@tailwindcss/postcss"]` to standard Tailwind v3 setup
3. **Updated CSS imports**: Changed from `@import "tailwindcss"` to `@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;`
4. **Cleaned webpack config**: Removed lightningcss-related configurations
5. **Updated Tailwind config**: Restored proper font families and configuration

## Files Modified

- `package.json` - Updated dependencies
- `postcss.config.mjs` - Changed to standard Tailwind v3 setup
- `src/app/globals.css` - Updated Tailwind imports
- `tailwind.config.js` - Restored proper configuration
- `next.config.mjs` - Removed lightningcss externals
- `.vercelignore` - Added deployment exclusions

## Deployment Steps

1. Ensure all changes are committed to your repository
2. Push to your main branch
3. Deploy to Vercel - the build should now succeed

## Verification

- ✅ Local build successful
- ✅ All dependencies properly installed
- ✅ No lightningcss dependency issues
- ✅ Tailwind CSS v3 working correctly

## Future Considerations

- Consider upgrading to Tailwind CSS v4 when the lightningcss native binary issues are resolved
- Monitor for updates to `@tailwindcss/postcss` that may fix the deployment issues
- Keep dependencies updated to avoid similar issues
